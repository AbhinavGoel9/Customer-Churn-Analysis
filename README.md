Thanks for sharing your previous README, Abhinav — it’s already well-structured and professional! Let’s now **enhance it** to reflect your new work: the machine learning model, churn driver insights, and strategy simulation.

Here’s your **updated README.md**:

# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Sector

This project is an end-to-end business analytics case study on customer churn in the telecom industry, using Python for data cleaning, Power BI for dashboard creation, and machine learning (Random Forest) for churn prediction and strategy simulation. It is based on the IBM Telco Customer dataset.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python (Colab)** – Data cleaning, EDA, KPI generation, churn prediction
- **Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn** – Data handling & visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning (Random Forest classifier)
- **Power BI (Online)** – Dashboard design & business insights
- **GitHub** – Version control and showcasing the project

---

## 📌 Business Objective

Help a telecom company understand **why customers churn**, identify **key churn drivers**, and simulate **retention strategies** to reduce future churn using data-driven insights.

---

## 📈 Key KPIs & Insights

**Churn Rate:** ~26.6%

🔺 Higher churn observed among:
- Customers with **month-to-month** contracts
- Users of **fiber-optic internet**
- Customers using **paperless billing**

🔻 Lower churn observed among:
- **Two-year** contract holders
- Senior citizens **with dependents**
- Customers with **tech support enabled**

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model (Churn Prediction)

To further understand churn behavior and test strategies, a **Random Forest model** was trained on the cleaned dataset.

- **Top churn drivers:** Contract Type, Monthly Charges, Internet Service
- **Model used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy and F1-score using classification report

---

## 🎯 Retention Strategy Simulation

A simple retention strategy was simulated:
> Convert all "Month-to-month" contract customers to "One year" contracts.

- **Before strategy:** Higher average churn probability
- **After strategy:** Significant drop in churn risk
- **Projected churn reduction:** **~10.28%**

This simulation provides a **data-backed justification** for implementing targeted retention campaigns.
